#PART A: Dual Form of Linear SVMs
'''
Implement the dual form of linear SVMs with slack variables. Please do not use the built-in SVM 
implementation in Matlab or sklearn. Instead, write a program that takes data as input, converts
it to the appropriate objective function and constraints, and then calls a quadratic programming
package to solve it. See the file optimizers.txt for installation and usage for matlab/python.

# JUST IMPLEMENT KERNEL VERSION AND USE phi(x) = x for PART A 




#PART B: Test Your Dual Form of Linear SVMs

#PART C: Test Your Dual Form of Linear SVMs
'''
he dual form SVM is useful for several reasons, including an ability to handle kernel functions 
that are hard to express as feature functions in the primal form. Extend your dual form SVM code 
to operate with kernels. Do the implementation as generally as possible, so that it either takes
 the kernel function or kernel matrix as input.
